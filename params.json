Each of the headers below links to the respective project web page.\r\n\r\n### [Robo-Shooter](http://reinkek.github.io/robo-shooter)\r\nIn this project, my team and I programmed a robotic arm to track and shoot a quadrotor UAV with a foam dart in the Stanford Robotics Lab.  We additionally modified the flight firmware to receive motion capture data over a radio link for autonomous position control.  \r\nLanguages: C, C++\r\n\r\n### [Game-Playing AI](http://reinkek.github.io/mc-rtbss)\r\nIn this project, a colleague and I wrote artificial intelligence software to play a simulated 2-D game with the goal of shooting a moving target with noisy sensor data.  The players' states can alter both the sensor performance and the targeting performance.  The AI agent attempts to optimally choose actions to localize the target and get into a good shooting position.  \r\nLanguages: Julia\r\n\r\n### [Quadrotor Navigation Simulation](http://reinkek.github.io/NaviQuad)\r\nIn this project, a colleague and I wrote an online path planning and optimal model predictive control algorithm to simulate the flight of a quadrotor UAV through an unknown, cluttered environment.  \r\nLanguages: Matlab","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
